            In order to show case my projects, I wanted to create a Portfolio
            website. I took this as an oppourtinty to explore web development.
            Using react and Next.js I created a dynamic webiste with lots of
            room to grow in the future.

            I created a discord bot to help first year engineering students
            manage their workload. It reads content from a community run task
            list on google sheets and updates students on what they need to get
            done on a given day

            In the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), teams have six weeks to
            build ~120 pound robots, that compete in an annual competition.
            Here's the code we worked on for Spartan Robotics' 2019 robot. I'm
            responsible for the arm control algorithm which uses a sin feed
            forward along with PID to maintain the arm position.

            The goal of this project was to consolidate several loose components
            for motor drivers and sensors into a single, easy to implement
            board. Overall space consumption was reduced by 200%!

            Designed for the 2020 FRC game, Infinite Recharge, the robot
            features a vectored intake, belted conveyor, as well as turreted
            fly-wheel shooter with an adjustable hood. While a prototype was
            made, unfortunately full assembly was discontinued due to the
            pandemic.

            Designed back in 2019, The goal of this project was to design a
            continously variable transmition for use in the FIRST Robotics
            Compoetion. While prototypes where unsucessful, it was an amazing
            learning experience.
